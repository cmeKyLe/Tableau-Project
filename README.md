## 🧠 Learnings & Reflections
This project provided a strong foundation in Tableau and helped me understand what goes into building effective visualizations. Key takeaways include:

- **Calculated Fields**: I learned how to create and apply calculated fields to transform raw data into meaningful metrics and KPIs. This was essential for building dynamic visuals like monthly trends and performance indicators.
- **Designing Clean Visuals**: I gained experience in designing dashboards that are both clean and visually appealing. Keeping layouts organized and using appropriate color cues helped improve readability and user experience.
- **Audience-Centered Thinking**: One of the most important lessons was understanding what stakeholders or viewers actually need to see. I learned how to tailor the dashboard to highlight the most relevant insights for the end user—whether that’s sales trends, profit breakdowns, or performance comparisons.

This experience has deepened my appreciation for the balance between technical data work and thoughtful design, which is crucial in real-world data visualization projects.
